  <p style="font-size: 27px;">What Is Robotics? </p>
  <hr/>
  <p style="color:#404040;">Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that  produces machines, called robots, <br/> that substitute for (or replicate) human actions. Pop culture has always been fascinated with robots. R2-D2.<br/>Optimus  Prime. WALL-E. These over-exaggerated, humanoid concepts of robots usually  seem like a caricature <br/>  of the real thing...or are they more forward thinking than  we realize? Robots are gaining intellectual and <br/> mechanical capabilities that don’t  put the possibility of a R2-D2-like machine out of reach in the future.</p></div>
  
   <div class="def">
   <p style="font-size: 27px; color:#002952;">WHAT IS A ROBOT?</p>
   <p style="color:#696969;">A robot is the product of the robotics field, where programmable machines are built that can assist humans or mimic human actions. Robots were  originally built to handle monotonous tasks (like building cars on an assembly line), but have since expanded well beyond their initial uses to  perform tasks like fighting fires, cleaning homes and assisting with  incredibly intricate surgeries. Each robot has a differing level of autonomy,  ranging from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks that a human has  full control over to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any  external influences.</p></div>

  <div class="def1">
 <p style="color:#404040;">As technology progresses, so too does the scope of what is considered robotics. In 2005, 90% of all robots  could  be <br/>found assembling cars in automotive factories. These robots  consist mainly of mechanical arms tasked with  welding  or <br/> screwing on certain parts of a car. Today, we’re seeing an evolved and expanded definition of robotics that includes the <br/> development, creation and use of bots that explore Earth’s harshest conditions, robots that assist law- enforcement <br/>and even robots that assist in almost every facet of healthcare. </p></div>

 <div class="def1">
 <p style="color:#404040;">In the Last Century, Robots in Science-Fiction have Risen Up Against their Human Masters; visited earth from distant stars to pass judgement on our Civilization; and relentlessly chased our leaders back in time in an effort to eradicate humanity itself.</p>

 <img src="z.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
 
 <p style="color:#404040;">Robots have always Lurked in our stories as bogeymen, and now their Real-world counterparts are steadily creeping into our lives. And to be perfectly honest, I find myself deeply excited. Since 1956, when a Stanford Professor named John McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence," our thinking machines have evolved from playing chess on a board with sixty-four squares to playing <i>Jeopardy!</i>with open ended questions asked out loud. We are reaching an unprecedented moment in history, in which robots have evolved from things into partners and allies with the ability to make their own decisions. Unlike every other tool ever built, robots are not simply objects to be manipulated, but agents that can think and act alongside us in the world. Our latest smart machines soar through hostile skies as warfighters, comb through online data for commerce, and in some cases, even wriggle through our veins to provide medical treatment. From the Aeolis Palus plains on mars to the sprawling corridors of darkened warehouses, a flood of advanced technology is rapidly growing to solve a dazzling variety of hard problems.</p>


 <p style="color:#404040;">As we progress deeper into the Information Age, new and astonishing robots will continue to proliferate in our homes, cities and places of work. How incredibly lucky are we to live during this amazing time? Together, we have the opportunity to learn more about our robotic partners and embrace an awe-inspiring future.</p>
